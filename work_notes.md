    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    The assignment was very clear and doable. I enjoyed it very much.
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    How the database connects to the site and seeing it happen. It was very rewarding to put stuff into the database that I made and have it stay there
    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? 
    Following along with Aaron and then understanding what parts of the code do what things. I still don't understand that part.
